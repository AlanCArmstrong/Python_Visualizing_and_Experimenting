# Python_Visualizing_and_Experimenting

In this project, I used Python to conduct a basic chi-squared test of independence to see if there was a relationship between areas and
the reason for patient admission. The p-value was 0.717, so I concluded it was not likely. The code:

I also created a stacked bar chart to confirm this:

To check for bias in the hospital, I found and graphed the correlation between length of stay and total charge and found a correlation of 0.988.
I concluded no bias. The scatter chart showing a high correlation:
